# Description
This is a small python program that detects Palindrome words and checks to see:
- if the word is palindrome right away.
- if the word is short of 1 letter to be palindrome.
- or the word isnt palindrome.
**(Pallindrome being the word entered spells and reads the same if even of the word is reversed)**.
